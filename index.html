        <h3>The Birth of Kurairyu</h3>
        <p>
            I was born on January 22nd, 1992 at midnight.
            I don't really remember my weight. My favorite color is black. I am 5'6 and I don't know my weight. I am a gamer by heart and I enjoy hanging out with my love ones. The reason of the website is for me to learn how to become a better computer programmer and learning as much as I can, so I can make a better future for myself and my future family. I am an Aquarius. It's pretty sweet being one. My horoscope tells me that I am a thinker and a caring person. Which is so true. I enjoy thinking about anything and everything. 
        </p>

        <h3>What made me create Kura's Sanctum?</h3>
        <p>
            Funny question and a funny answer. I woke up this morning at my usual time to get myself ready for work. The previous night was amazing. Playing cards with the one I love and having the one of the best cooks ever making a spectacular dinner. I was sitting there thinking about what I want to do with myself, and how can I better myself as a human being. Yeah just imagine a wonderful plate, a deck of cards, and a amazing woman sitting right across from me. Unfornately I was a bit of a quiet person last night. Boring yeah I know I bored the crap out of her which is never good. But to continue answering the question before I go completely off-topic. While I was on the train going to work I decided to ask myself a few questions to help the travel go by. My first question was How can I Kura become a better human being than I was the day before. My second question was How can I push myself more to achieve my goals. My third question was How more of an amzing day this would have started if I had woken up next to the woman of my dreams. And my fourth and final question was If the woman I love told me that she was finally ready to be into a relationship with me How would we celebrate our first night together as a couple. So while I was thinking about these questions on the train. I fell asleep and when I woke up It came to me that I will create this website just to say that I am putting my foot in the door to begin my travel to a better future.</p>
        <h4>Closing</h4>
        <p>For now this is the end for this chapter. I will do more research on how to do more things with this website. If you have any comments or any helpful tips do contact me. Also do comment on how your day was before and after reading this. Have a wonderful day...</p>
